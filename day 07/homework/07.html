 <p>The third generation of the BMW 3 Series range of compact executive cars is designated under the model code E36, and was produced by the German automaker BMW from 1990 to 2000. The initial models were of the four-door sedan body style, followed by the coupé, convertible, wagon ("Touring"), and eventually hatchback ("Compact").

    The E36 was the first 3 Series to be offered in a hatchback body style. It was also the first 3 Series to be available with a six-speed manual transmission (in the 1996 M3), a five-speed automatic transmission, and a four-cylinder diesel engine. The multi-link rear suspension was also a significant upgrade as compared to the previous generations of the 3 Series. All-wheel drive was not available for the E36, unlike the previous (E30) and successive (E46) generations.
    
    The E36 was named in Car and Driver magazine's 10Best list for every year it was on sale.[4]
    
    Following the introduction of its successor, the E46 3 Series in 1998, the E36 began to be phased out and was eventually replaced in 1999.</p>

    <h2>Development of the E36 began in 1981[5] and the exterior design was heavily influenced by aerodynamics, specifically the overall wedge shape, headlight covers and smaller wing mirrors.[6] The lead designers were Pinky Lai[7] and Boyke Boyer.[8][9]

        The production version of the E36 was launched in October 1990, with press release in November and market launch in early 1991.[10] The Touring (E36/3) did not go on sale until March 1995, with the Touring version of the previous generation having remained on sale until April 1994 alongside the E36 sedans and coupés.[11] At first, the Touring was only offered in 320i and 328i versions; in July 1995 the 318 tds Touring arrived, followed by the 318i in September.</h2>
    <h3></h3> 
    All models are rear-wheel drive since the E36 was not produced with all-wheel drive (unlike its predecessor and successor). The E36 chassis was all new, using the "Z-axle" multilink suspension proven in the 1989 BMW Z1, and designed with rear toe-in to minimize the oversteering characteristics of the preceding generation.[18] Unlike the other body styles, the hatchback (known as the "E36/5" or "BMW Compact") used a rear semi-trailing arm suspension based on the older E30 instead, in order to save space due to its truncated rear end.
    <h4>Available safety equipment included a driver's airbag, passenger airbag (from 1993 production) and side impact airbags in later models,[19] ABS braking and stability control ("ASC +T").[20] The dashboard was designed to accommodate the passenger side airbag from the beginning, which limited the size of the glove compartment.[21] Available in the sedan and Touring, a rear seat with two integrated children's booster seats was a first for BMW.[11]

        Electronic climate control was also available on the E36. In North America, cars equipped with the "Winter Package" also have heated seats and side mirrors.</h4>
        <h5>The four-cylinder petrol engines used in the E36 range were initially engines carried over from the previous generation 3 Series: the BMW M40 SOHC engine and the BMW M42 DOHC engine. In 1993, the M40 was replaced by the BMW M43 SOHC engine and the M42 was replaced in 1996 by the BMW M44 DOHC engine. To retain a 50/50 weight distribution (on petrol models), versions fitted with the heavier, six-cylinder engines had the battery relocated to the trunk.[22]</h5>
        <h6>For the six-cylinder models, the E36 was launched with the then-new BMW M50 DOHC petrol engine. In late 1992 the M50TU versions added single-VANOS (variable valve timing), which increased torque (peak power was unchanged). In 1995, the BMW M52 engine replaced the M50TU, resulting in the 328i model replacing the 325i and the addition of a new mid-range 323i model (powered by a 2.5 litre version of the M52).</h6>
